## Forking This Repo (Please Read!)

Many people have contacted me asking if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer is **yes — with attribution**.

I value keeping this project open source, but plagiarism is wrong. It's disheartening to find people copying this site without credit. I invested time and creativity into designing and building it, and I'm proud of it!
